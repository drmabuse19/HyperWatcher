# HyperWatch

HyperWatch is a TypeScript React project that provides a streamlined platform for watching streams across different platforms. It offers a user-friendly interface and efficient performance to enhance your streaming experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with HyperWatch, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd HyperWatch`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view HyperWatch.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is now ready to be deployed.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project, copying all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them.
